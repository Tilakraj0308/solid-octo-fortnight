We want to facilitate a future where hosting short-term rentals is at least as easy as managing long-term rentals.\n\nToday, we do this by helping Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com hosts deliver a great and personal guest experience at scale, automatically, though native API integrations, machine-learning, and robust software.\n\n### Our team\n\nWe are a small, but impactful team of 17 people, working all over Asia, Europe and North America. Our team is fully remote and distributed. We embrace the fact that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. \n\nWe (*used to* \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00ba) organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last trips were to Lisbon, Prague, Paris, Tenerife and Brussels. We are all really looking forward to the next time we would all be able to be together.\n\n### Our company\n\nOur company is bootstrapped (no third-party investor) and profitable, with a solo founder (@Pierre-Camille Hamana) who built the first version of the product. We are interested in building a great, growing and sound business. That seems to be working: we help our customers manage over  205,000 properties in 151 countries, with a world-class NPS (\u00c2\u00b170).\n\n### How we recruit\n\nAmongst our core values are transparency and humility. To help you in finding out more about Hospitable, we are releasing an \"Applicant Handbook\" (on Notion \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f) that may help you find out more about us, from us: \n\n[Applicant Handbook](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ApplicantHandbook)\n\n### Where we're at with product:\n\n- 2018: We added HomeAway (now Vrbo) as a second integration alongside Airbnb, entered channel management territory with our Sync product, and started offering in-depth occupancy and financial metrics.\n- 2019: We rebranded and launched an entirely new, modern web app experience.\n- 2020: Apart from a few wildcard projects in response to the pandemic (\u00f0\u009f\u00aa\u00a6\u00e2\u0098\u00a0\u00ef\u00b8\u008f RIP footshake, \"churchill\", and \"napoleon\"), we spent this challenging year improving and simplifying the customer experience across the board.\n- Q1 2021: we've released two of the most requested features: our official [Booking.com](http:\/\/booking.com) integration - adding a 3rd major platform alongside Airbnb and Vrbo - as well as the ability to manually add bookings Hospitable's calendar and inbox. Other highly requested features are in the works.\n- Looking forward: we'll be improving our channel management and messaging product line, expanding the \"people\" (cleaning, check-in) product tremendously, and exploring a completely new product direction that's crazy ambitious.\n\n### Where we're at with tech:\n\n- Late 2018: We refactored the original Slim\/Laravel hybrid to a full Laravel application with a manageable code structure.\n- Mid 2019: We completed a full rearchitecting of the web app, with clear separation of Angular frontend, an API layer, and backend workers.\n- 2020: No comment.\n- Now: we're pretty comfortable with containerisation, micro-services, and k8s, but still prefer our \"majestic\" \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008f monolith.\n- Looking forward: we'll be working with more and more external API partners, exploring GPT-3, building a payments infrastructure, and laying the technical groundwork for the crazy ambitious products to come.\n\nWe are bold, like risks, and take on big challenges together. \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 Our customers love the product, provide valuable feedback, and trust us to rapidly help them with more of their problems.\n\n# Who you are\n\nYou are a fantastic human seeking to build something amazing with other fantastic humans!\n\nMore specifically, you are a unique blend \u00f0\u009f\u00a6\u0084 : \n\n- You care deeply about customer experience and user journeys.\n- You are a self starter and are eager to discover the \"why\" as well as the \"what\" create the spec rather than wait for it.\n- Your compass points toward customer and business value.\n- All while being a full stack software engineer, whose code is a means, not an end.\n\nPretty magical.\n\n### What you will be working on\n\n- Discovering, shaping, and building new products and features that demand to see the light of day.\n- Designing and coding the architecture of our core systems and micro-services.\n- Developing code that is a joy to work with.\n\n### What you will unlock\n\n- So much personal potential!\n- Fantastic user reviews when we give them more of their life back.\n- Team kudos. \u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0089\n\n### What does success look like?\n\n- Week 2: you're aware of how various parts of the product work and why they matter.\n- Week 4: you've chosen, planned, built, and shipped a small feature that provides value to customers.\n- Month 3: although there are still plenty of parts of the code that you aren't familiar with, you're confidently expanding Hospitable's products and features and asking for help when needed. We've got your back.\n\n### How we will grow together\n\n- Exposure to a product-fanatical team's iterations of features and the company itself.\n- Personal engineering level-up \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0084 through daily, compounding improvements.\n- You will receive (and provide) frequent code reviews and team reviews.\n- You will be challenged, and you learn how to rise to the occasion. \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa\n- Sure, we aren't building reusable rockets, but our long-term vision for remote real-estate investors is pretty grand.\n\n### What you'll need to bring with you\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082If you're hesitant to apply for this position because you feel that you don't meet this list of qualifications fully, don't worry! We want to hear from you.\n\n- Good knowledge of PHP 7+, Laravel, and MySQL.\n- Caring about the impact your code has on your team, your customers, and their customers.\n- Attention to detail and eagerness for constant improvement.\n- Everything else is a lovely bonus that we're excited to hear about!\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a1When applying, please be sure two answer two questions:\n1. What does product engineering mean to you?\n2. Could you tell us about a life experience that gave you a unique perspective?\n\n# What we offer\n\nFor us, the company itself is also a product, one that we iterate on. We're always improving and creating an environment where we all love to work.\n\n- \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0097 A supportive and caring team environment.\n- \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u008e Competitive salary.\n- \u00f0\u009f\u008f\u0096 Ample - and encouraged - paid leave.\n- \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u00bc Maternity and paternity leave.\n- \u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a9 All the resources and tools that you need to succeed, including budget for personal development.",

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never understood why companies pretend they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re something that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in the hiring process - you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find out eventually so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather you know who we are up front so we can both make sure this is a good fit for all involved.\n* __Quick turnaround time.__ We know you have lots of options so we move fast usually in less than a week from start to finish.\n\n\n\n### \u00e2\u009a\u0099\u00ef\u00b8\u008f TECH STACK\n\nWe use all of the following technologies.

But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to put a big dent in a gigantic industry, something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be proud of a decade from now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also a startup. Priorities change all the time, something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always on fire, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twice as much work to do as hands to do it. Its uncomfortable, new challenges surface constantly, and that means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to you to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well-funded, with advisors and investors who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built legendary companies. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also deploying that capital aggressively, so you should expect uncertainty and discomfort. If the above sounds daunting, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a perfectly sound and reasonable person who probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit in at Leaf. If this strikes you as an exhilarating environment, well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk.\n\n#LI-Remote\n\nCompensation\n\nLeaf offers a very comprehensive compensation package including competitive base salary, variable compensation and health benefits.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLeaf Logistics is an equal-opportunity employer and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a passionate team player who wants to have an outsized impact on a diverse and dynamic team, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear from you!",

        "description": "Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.\n\nOne of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.\n\nWe\n\u00c2\u00a0- are allergic to over-engineering.\n\u00c2\u00a0- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.\n\u00c2\u00a0- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out \u00e2\u0080\u009cpats on the back\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist yet, we will build it.\n\u00c2\u00a0- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).\n\nAs an early member of our ML engineering team, you will help\n\u00c2\u00a0- push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning\n\u00c2\u00a0- build the team and drive the direction of the company.\n\u00c2\u00a0- shape our product and culture.\n\u00c2\u00a0- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial lives.\n\nThe following is a big plus\n\u00c2\u00a0- fluency in Python, Rust and PyTorch\n\u00c2\u00a0- experience with training and deploying models in multi-GPU environments\n\u00c2\u00a0- recognized open-source contributions\n\u00c2\u00a0- participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, IOI, IMO, Topcoder, Kaggle, etc.)\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat if I recommend someone who ends up getting hired?\n\nWe will give you 20k USD for the referral.\n\nWhere is Ntropy located?\n\nWe are fully remote, with a virtual base in New York, US.\n\nWhat time-zones do you work with?\n\nWe hire anywhere in GMT-7 to GMT+1.\n\nDo you consider part-time work?\n\nNot at the moment. Full-time roles only.\n\nHow are you funded?\n\nWe are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call.\n\nDo you already have a product?\n\nYes. In production since 1st April 2021.\n\nDo you plan to sell customer data?\n\nNtropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains.\n\nWhat is the interview process like?\n\n1. Send us problems you have solved before and how. Please include as much detail as possible: code, algorithms, derivations, proofs, etc. We will then do a video call to kick things off and go through it (45 mins).\n\n2. We will give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (3-4 hours). Alternatively, if you have a relevant project that you worked on previously that demonstrates your skills as an engineer, you are welcome to use that instead.\n\n3. We will then do a deep-dive through the project over a call and discuss the implementation, improvements and bottlenecks.\n\nAbove all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are at during the whole process.\n\nWhat are your hiring plans?\n\nWe aim to be 22-25 people in the next 6 months. Mostly engineering roles.\n\nWhat is your current stack?\n\nback-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)\ncompute - AWS + Azure\nML - PyTorch + ONNX\n\nWork \/ life balance?\n\nWe are a startup which requires you to put in a lot more work and soul  than a regular job. It will require long hours and sacrificing your free  time. We believe, however, that nothing easy is worth doing. We will  expect a lot from you, and you should expect a lot from us.\n\nWhat is the compensation?\n\n$130k \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 0.2% - 0.5%\n\n",
